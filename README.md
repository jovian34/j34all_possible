# j34all_possible
a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing between the numbers 1,2,…,9

This is Carl James' answer to the simple problem:

Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing between the numbers 1,2,…,9 (in this order) such that the result is 100. For example 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 + 78 + 9 = 100.
